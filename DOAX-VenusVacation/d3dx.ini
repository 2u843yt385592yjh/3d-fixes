; instead of just a single stand-alone mod (e.g. facilitating mesh/texture
; replacements or other graphics mods), you can include an entire directory
; where users can extract third party mods created by others and 3DMigoto will
; include every .ini file and any external files referred to by CustomShader /
; Resource sections (Replaced shaders in these mods should still go in
; ShaderFixes for now, unless the modders want to use CustomShaders or

; This custom shader will automatically adjust the convergence to try to keep
; the game comfortable to look at no matter how the camera changes. Check the
; [Constants] section for some ways to tune this to your liking, or comment
; this out to disable it altogether if you prefer manual convergence:

; Uncomment to enable a custom shader that implements a software mouse cursor.
; Use in games that use a hardware cursor if you want to be able to adjust the
; stereo depth of the mouse, or to work with the below 3DVision2SBS shader.
; Note that this shader has a higher latency than the hardware cursor!
;include = ShaderFixes\mouse.ini

; Uncomment to enable a custom shader that allows the stereo output mode to be
; changed to Side-by-Side or Top-and-Bottom via the F11 key. If you are using
; SLI and this isn't working properly (partially blank or stuck image) you may

; Custom settings override for any of [convergence, separation, x, y, z, w]
;
; Four types are supported - by default the bindings will simply load the
; configured settings, but type=hold can be specified to have a preset
; active while the button is held, type=toggle can be used to make a simple
; on/off toggle, and type=cycle can be used to cycle forwards and/or backwards
; between several presets.
;
; Delays (type=hold only) and linear or cosine trasition periods (any key type)
; can be used to better synchonrise setting changes to the game's animations,
; or to smoothly adjust UI elements over a short period of time.
;
; Key bindings: For A-Z and 0-9 on the number row, just use that single
; character. For everything else (including mouse buttons), use the virtual key
; name (with or without the VK_ prefix) or hex code from this article:
; http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx
;
; Key combinations can be specified by separating key names with spaces, e.g.
; "Shift Q". It is also possible to indicate that a key must *not* be held for
; the binding to activate, e.g. "NO_ALT F1" would prevent the binding from
; activating when taking a 3D Screenshot with Alt F1. "NO_MODIFIERS" may be
; used as a shorthand for excluding all standard modifiers (Ctrl, Alt, Shift,
; Windows).
;
; Keys can also be from XBox controllers using:
;   XB_LEFT_TRIGGER, XB_RIGHT_TRIGGER,
;   XB_LEFT_SHOULDER, XB_RIGHT_SHOULDER,
;   XB_LEFT_THUMB, XB_RIGHT_THUMB,
;   XB_DPAD_UP, XB_DPAD_DOWN, XB_DPAD_LEFT, XB_DPAD_RIGHT,
;   XB_A, XB_B, XB_X, XB_Y, XB_START, XB_BACK, XB_GUIDE
; By default all attached controllers are used - to associate a binding with a
; specific controller add the controller number 1-4 to the prefix, like
; XB2_LEFT_TRIGGER, though this may be more useful for hunting than playing.
;
; Multiple keys may be set in a single [Key] section to allow keyboard and xbox
; controller toggles and cycles to share the same state as each other.

; Cosine transitions are used to smooth the changes over 1/10 of a second.
; Both keyboard and Xbox controller buttons are bound to this same cycle, so

;        dump_cb: Dumps constant buffers
;        dump_vb: Dumps vertex buffers
;        dump_ib: Dumps index buffers
;
; Texture2D format selection:
;        jpg/jps: Dumps out 2D/stereo resources as .jps files. These are the easiest
;                 to work with and don't take up as much space as DDS files, but
;                 they are not dumped for every resource and are missing some data.
;            dds: Dumps out 2D/stereo resources as .dds files. WARNING: This option
;                 may require hundreds of gigabytes and a long time! Only use it if
;                 you absolutely need more information than you can get otherwise.
;        jps_dds: Dumps out .jps when possible, .dds otherwise (default).
;           desc: Dumps out DirectX resource descriptions to .dsc files.
;
; Buffer format selection:
;            buf: Dumps out buffers as binary .buf files
;            txt: Decodes buffers as text, and includes some extra metadata not
;                 found in the .buf files. May not correctly decode all buffers.
;                 Default if dump_cb/vb/ib was specified.
;           desc: Dumps out DirectX resource descriptions to .dsc files.
;
; Misc options:
;           hold: Continue analysing subsequent frames while the key is held
;       clear_rt: Clears each render target the first time they are used in the
;                 frame. Makes it easier to see what is being drawn if the game
;                 doesn't clear them, but might cause some effects not to render.
;   filename_reg: Normally the draw number is the first part of the filename so
;                 that the files will be sorted in the order they were used in
;                 the game. Sometimes it is more desirable to examine how a
;                 specific output changed through the frame and this option will
;                 place the register number first in the filename to allow that.
;           mono: Dump out mono textures instead of stereo. To dump both, specify
;                 'mono stereo'. If neither are specified, defaults to stereo.
;  dump_on_unmap: Dumps buffers/textures whenever the game maps them to the CPU
;                 with the Map() / Unmap() calls. Typically used to update
;                 constant buffers.
; dump_on_update: Dumps buffers/textures whenever the game updates them with
;                 the UpdateSubresource() call. Alternative method used to
;                 update constant buffers.
;    share_dupes: Use a folder that is shared with subsequent frame analysis
;                 dumps for de-duplicating dumped resources. Makes future frame
;                 analysis dumps faster and use less disk space if there are a
;                 lot of identical textures, but less trivial to delete
;                 individual dump folders to reclaim disk space (i.e. all or
;                 nothing). Individual frame analysis folders are still
;                 de-duplicated regardless of this setting.
;        symlink: Try to use symbolic links when de-duplicating files in a
;                 frame analysis dump. Requires developer mode to be enabled in
;                 Windows 10, and will fall back to hard links or shortcuts
;                 when not possible. Useful to see the relationship between
;                 deduplicated files, especially when working with cygwin, but
;                 some Windows applications may behave worse when using these.
;
; Experimental Deferred Context (multi-threaded rendering) Frame Analyis Support:
;   deferred_ctx_immediate: Dumps resources from deferred contexts using the
;                 immediate context. Not suitable for dump_rt or other
;                 resources altered during the frame (by the GPU or CPU). May
;                 be ok for static unchanging resources, such as collecting HUD
;                 textures for filtering. Not thread safe - potential to crash.
;                 Recommended (not enforced) to use in conjunction with 'mono'.
;    deferred_ctx_accurate: Delays dumping resources from deferred contexts
;                 until after the GPU has updated them. Copies of *all*
;                 resources being dumped are held in memory, so it may run out
;                 - try to restrict using this option to specific resources
;                 where it is needed - preferably via the "dump" command rather
;                 than the global analyse_options. Works with 'stereo'.
;
; analyse_options can also be specified in [ShaderOverride*] sections (or other
; command lists) to set up triggers to change the options mid-way through a
; frame analysis, either for a single draw call (default), or permanently (by
; adding the 'persist' keyword).
;
; Alternatively, "dump" can be specified in a [ShaderOverride*] section (or
; any other command list) to dump specific resources with per-resource options
; (e.g. "dump = dump_tex dds share_dupes mono ps-t0"), dump resources at a
; specific point in time (e.g. "pre dump = o0") or dump a custom resource that
; frame analysis cannot otherwise see (e.g. "dump = ResourceDepthBuffer"). Use
; additional "dump" commands to dump multiple resources.

; On the fly regular expression shader patching engine
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; These sections define regular expressions to match against shaders and apply
; certain classes of fixes on the fly. Only assembly shaders are supported by
; this method for reliability and performance reasons.
;
; Every pattern must have a main section prefixed with ShaderRegex:
;
;[ShaderRegex1]
; shader_model is required and must be set to the types of shaders that this
; pattern will be applied against. Multiple shader models can be specified to
; match the pattern against multiple types. There are some differences in
; instructions between shader model 4 and 5 (such as in resource load
; instructions), so in some cases you may need separate patterns for each.
;shader_model = ps_4_0 ps_5_0
;
; temps is used to give names to temporary registers that you will use in the
; pattern. 3DMigoto will identify free register numbers and automatically
; adjust dcl_temps as required.
;temps = stereo tmp1
;
; This main section also acts as a command list so that you can define actions
; that will be applied on every matching shader, just as you would on any other
; command list enabled section, such as ShaderOverride, Present, etc.
;
;
; The next section of interest is the regular expression pattern. If this
; section is omitted than every shader of with matching shader_model will be
; matched (and have the command lists and InsertDeclarations processed). The
; first part of the section name must match the main ShaderRegex section you
; defined above, and it ends with ".Pattern". The regular expression grammar
; that we support is PCRE2, which is largely compatible with the powerful Perl
; and Python grammars. You can find the syntax reference here, but generally
; speaking any regular expression tutorial will give you a good primer:
;
;   http://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2syntax.html
;
; Note that since this is parsed in an ini file that blank lines and ini
; comments are ignored, and preceding and trailing whitespace from each line
; will be stripped, so if you need to match an indented line you will need to
; explicitly match the whitespace at the start of the line with \s*
; You should also use \n to match the newline character at the end of each
; line. This should not be confused with extended mode activated by the (?x)
; switch, which will ignore *all* whitespace to allow complex patterns to be
; broken up for clarity.
;
; Multiline matching is enabled by default, as is case insensitivity (due to
; differences in the capitalisation produced by different versions of the
; disassembler), but PCRE2 provides switches for most of these options if you
; need something else.
;
; This is an example of how you might match a matrix multiply in a shader, and
; uses Python style named capture groups to pull out the registers and swizzles
; of the X and Z coordinates, and another named capture group to verify that
; the register used in the div instruction matches the one used in the multiply:
;
;[ShaderRegex1.Pattern]
;mul r\d+\.xyzw, r\d+\.yyyy, cb0\[28\]\.xyzw\n
;mad r\d+\.xyzw, (?P<pos_x>r\d+)\.(?P<swizzle_x>[xyzw])[xyzw]{3}, cb0\[27\]\.xyzw, r\d+\.xyzw\n
;mad r\d+\.xyzw, (?P<pos_z>r\d+)\.(?P<swizzle_z>[xyzw])[xyzw]{3}, cb0\[29\]\.xyzw, r\d+\.xyzw\n
;add (?P<result>r\d+)\.xyzw, r\d+\.xyzw, cb0\[30\]\.xyzw\n
;div r\d+\.[xyzw]{2}, (?P=result)\.[xyzw]{4}, r\d+\.wwww\n
;
;
; The next section specifies how to modify the matched pattern. Again the name
; must begin with the same name as the main section, and end in
; ".Pattern.Replace" (there is a reason the replacement is associated with the
; pattern, but that's coming soon). You can (and I highly encourage that you
; do) use named capture groups in the above pattern and substitute them in
; here. Temporary registers that you defined in the main ShaderRegex section
; are also available here with the same syntax as named capture groups. Use
; ${0} to indicate where the matched pattern goes, allowing you to insert code
; before and/or after it, or use additonal capture groups to insert code in the
; middle. Extended substitution is enabled in PCRE2, which among other things
; makes \n insert a newline.
;
;[ShaderRegex1.Pattern.Replace]
;\n
;// UE4 shadow correction:\n
;ld_indexable(texture2d)(float,float,float,float) ${stereo}.xyzw, l(0, 0, 0, 0), t125.xyzw\n

;\n

; 3DMigoto will check that this declaration has not already been inserted
; first. Typically this is used to get access to StereoParams in t125:

; 2018-12-07: Now noting down bytecode hashes as these are more resiliant
; against changes that only touch reflection info in the shader invalidating
; 3dmigoto hashes in the future. Could potentially switch hash calculation to
; bytecode, but that would invalidate all the remaining hashes that the update
; did not. These are easy enough to check with cmd_Decompiler (from 3DMigoto
; releases page) to assemble shaders (alternatively set export_binary=1) and
; dx11shaderanalyse.py --bytecode-hash (from DarkStarSword's 3d-fixes
; repository)
;
; Hint for finding new version where the bytecode did change if you're too lazy
; to hunt it: The instruction count increased by 2 and the diff should only
; show one constant buffer increase in size by one, and three lines just before
; the ret (one changed, two inserted).

; 2019-04-25: Continuation of the previous update - many of the shaders that
; did not previously use the new parameter now do. Leaving in the old & new
; hashes since we now have the Steam version which has not yet received these
; new hashes.
